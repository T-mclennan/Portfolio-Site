# This was my last [Portfolio-Site](https://tristan-mclennan-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)

### I designed and built this portolio in React.js, deployed on Heroku!

### Features: 
  - I built a custom typewriter animation, that randomly selects from my fav programming quotes. 
  - Simple layout with static sidebar and footer, cards with project details and links.
  - Sidebar contains jumps to each project section.
  - Top of scroll begins with black screen and star overlay, fades into blue, then other colors per project. 
  - Each card has a picture from project faded in behind the title. 
  
### I built this before I knew how to make responsive websites, this is not built for mobile screens!
##### I hope to return soon to add responsive functionality. In the meantime I built a responsive portfolio [here](https://t-mclennan.github.io/).
